# Our mission
On a mission to end the first cause of deaths and injuries on the road

# Solution
We partnered with [Core for Tech](https://corefortech.com/en/) to develop early warning system for driver drowsiness.
Our goal is to detect early signs of drowsiness using hear rate and hear rate variability data.
Hear Rate sensors are widely available, already integrated in various devices (i.e. smartwatches). No additional wired sensors or cameras needed.
